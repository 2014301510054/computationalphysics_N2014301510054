> * Problem 1.5
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into type B, while nuclei of type B decay into type A. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are 
 $$\frac{dN_A}{t} \quad=\frac{N_B}{\tau}-\frac{N_A}{\tau},$$
 $$\frac{dN_B}{\tau}=\frac{N_A}{\tau}-\frac{N_A}{\tau},$$
 
where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant,$\tau$ . Solve the system of equations for the numbers of nuclei, $N_A$ and$N_B$ , as functions of time. Consider different initial confitions, such as$N_A =100$, $N_B=0$, etc., and take$\tau =1$ s. Show that your numerical results are consistent with the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which  $N_A$  and $N_B$ are constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives $\frac{dN_A}{t} \quad$and$\frac{dN_B}{t} \quad$ should vanish.
